# XRFOC
> For the sake of **weak dependency** on Hardware Characteristics, the **XRFOC** is implemented by me to obtain multi-platform impact.   
> Initially, all the algorithm and code is conducted on a 3nd-version revised board , which now supported closed loop foc.      
> There is any future use ...  

# Hardware
  The Least System board  is based on **"STM32F030R8T6"**.
> ([Schematic](./Hardware/Schematic_Board.pdf))  
> ([STM32F030R8T6](http://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers/stm32f030r8.html) @ 48MHz with 64KB of flash and 8KB of RAM).
