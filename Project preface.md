# XRFOC
> [!note] BackGround
> For the sake of **weak dependency** on Hardware Characteristics, the **XRFOC** is implemented by me to obtain multi-platform impact.   
> Initially, all the algorithm and code is conducted on a 3nd-version revised board , which now supported closed loop foc.      
There is any future use ...
